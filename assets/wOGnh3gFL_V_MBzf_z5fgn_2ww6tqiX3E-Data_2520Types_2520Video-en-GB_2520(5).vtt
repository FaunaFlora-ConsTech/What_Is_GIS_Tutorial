70afe467-dddf-4402-adf2-96e690735504-0
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.578
In this video we'll be going
over the different types of GIS

70afe467-dddf-4402-adf2-96e690735504-1
00:00:09.578 --> 00:00:09.880
data.

7a227463-8e7d-4a9a-86ae-823add08149d-0
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.093
GIS data is data that has
geographic information

7a227463-8e7d-4a9a-86ae-823add08149d-1
00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:17.150
referenced to specific locations
on Earth.

e4845d63-77a5-490b-a28a-29759ce050ef-0
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.223
You can see that we're looking
at an area in between Guinea and

e4845d63-77a5-490b-a28a-29759ce050ef-1
00:00:21.223 --> 00:00:21.640
Liberia.

f73f2da3-b5ea-442b-87f4-4a07ebd46eeb-0
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.031
We'll be using this area to add
different data layers to

f73f2da3-b5ea-442b-87f4-4a07ebd46eeb-1
00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:29.660
demonstrate the different types
of GIS data you can come across.

7ae8f1f0-d585-4788-8d85-18bfd66ab374-0
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.729
GIS data falls into two
different categories, vector or

7ae8f1f0-d585-4788-8d85-18bfd66ab374-1
00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:39.171
raster. Vector data is data
represented by either points,

7ae8f1f0-d585-4788-8d85-18bfd66ab374-2
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:40.550
lines or polygons.

3b716699-2972-408d-b590-9624834c15f5-0
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.620
First of all, let's take a look
at some point data.

1dcfa283-0434-4afe-bebe-03f17d310943-0
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.157
So this is point data
representing the locations of

1dcfa283-0434-4afe-bebe-03f17d310943-1
00:00:50.157 --> 00:00:54.150
different species of dinosaur
spotted within this area.

da07d390-e268-45c9-b315-993dfc529ec6-0
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.328
So you can see that each data
point tells us which species was

da07d390-e268-45c9-b315-993dfc529ec6-1
00:01:00.328 --> 00:01:05.080
sighted, and it gives the XY
coordinate for where the species

da07d390-e268-45c9-b315-993dfc529ec6-2
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.000
was sighted.

c1c87502-d896-4b9e-ae59-bbfc9ce4afc1-0
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.426
So point data is normally used
to show the location of features

c1c87502-d896-4b9e-ae59-bbfc9ce4afc1-1
00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:16.655
and points of interest, for
example the sightings of species

c1c87502-d896-4b9e-ae59-bbfc9ce4afc1-2
00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:18.250
or cities or buildings.

b062015b-9478-423e-afba-f8815e8a93b3-0
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.499
We can't use this data to
measure area or length, but we

b062015b-9478-423e-afba-f8815e8a93b3-1
00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.838
can measure density by
calculating the number of points

b062015b-9478-423e-afba-f8815e8a93b3-2
00:01:25.838 --> 00:01:27.210
within a specific area.

3a4b0ef5-d876-4700-b1be-d8f13938969b-0
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.930
OK, let's move on to line data.

9a09d66b-79e9-421b-a2d8-57eb73bfc2e2-0
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.502
So our line data here is
representing the roads and

9a09d66b-79e9-421b-a2d8-57eb73bfc2e2-1
00:01:37.502 --> 00:01:38.920
tracks within this area.

9e819a5a-8748-4ab0-98bb-b93179095fcd-0
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.345
Line data is used to represent
linear features like roads or

9e819a5a-8748-4ab0-98bb-b93179095fcd-1
00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:45.520
rivers or paths.

a00be480-294e-4c46-8c13-7570d8710505-0
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.930
This type of GIS data has one
dimension, meaning we can use it

a00be480-294e-4c46-8c13-7570d8710505-1
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.660
to calculate the length, For
example the length of this road.

b11ad6f6-321c-4b2d-9422-8cada360b841-0
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.570
Next, let's take a look at
polygon data.

525116c1-48a7-4c5c-b3e7-a246b0aef2a4-0
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.630
So this polygon is representing
the protected area of Ziama.

55c57424-c5d2-402a-b878-9b34c61bd58b-0
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.909
Polygons are used to represent
areas, for example protected

55c57424-c5d2-402a-b878-9b34c61bd58b-1
00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.760
areas or lakes or forests.

da43d96e-6231-4b10-b33c-f8ea5fbfe328-0
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.810
This type of GIS data has 2
dimensions and so we can use

da43d96e-6231-4b10-b33c-f8ea5fbfe328-1
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.320
polygons to calculate the area,
for example the area of Ziama.

0bff1401-0d4d-479e-929a-64149430d75a-0
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.850
So these are the three types of
vector data.

c6b04ab6-6dc8-41ef-9db2-995cdd0b51e9-0
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.360
Point

e9e65a55-fdcb-4740-b8c3-6c54199b7a4e-0
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.060
Line

a593d353-582c-40d8-949c-c45ad2459f84-0
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.240
and Polygon.

5153c043-2edd-42dc-bb9a-aa65e4379ae6-0
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.430
So now let's take a look at
raster data.

2e06a49b-11cc-4c5a-b9de-58fce80436c0-0
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.325
So we can think of raster data
as like a photograph made-up of

2e06a49b-11cc-4c5a-b9de-58fce80436c0-1
00:02:42.325 --> 00:02:46.147
pixels, where each pixel
represents a value. Raster data

2e06a49b-11cc-4c5a-b9de-58fce80436c0-2
00:02:46.147 --> 00:02:49.970
can be discrete or continuous.
This is a discrete raster

2e06a49b-11cc-4c5a-b9de-58fce80436c0-3
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.720
showing the land cover within
this area.

1db421f1-f290-4a17-9ae8-c49350d984e3-0
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.352
It's discrete as each cell has a
distinct separate value that

1db421f1-f290-4a17-9ae8-c49350d984e3-1
00:02:57.352 --> 00:03:00.950
represents a category or number.
So if we zoom in here,

0748e1f9-b553-4795-88ec-149939053f8c-0
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.692
we can see that each cell
corresponds with a type of land

0748e1f9-b553-4795-88ec-149939053f8c-1
00:03:06.692 --> 00:03:07.140
cover.

3bdf683d-4258-451e-84bd-44ef80d7a115-0
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.320
If we click on an orange cell
for example,

b569917e-aa55-470c-b06e-40e467ca4e65-0
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.495
we can see that it's got a value
of four and this is

b569917e-aa55-470c-b06e-40e467ca4e65-1
00:03:19.495 --> 00:03:22.320
corresponding to active
agriculture.

16b19d82-b297-4150-ac94-236a93ea5507-0
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.950
So now let's take a look at a
continuous raster.

26aba191-0680-49ff-8e94-c61b910a820a-0
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.481
So this continuous raster is
representing elevation.

26aba191-0680-49ff-8e94-c61b910a820a-1
00:03:33.481 --> 00:03:38.474
Continuous rasters also have
grid cells, but with gradually

26aba191-0680-49ff-8e94-c61b910a820a-2
00:03:38.474 --> 00:03:43.801
changing data so each cell has a
value within a range. For this

26aba191-0680-49ff-8e94-c61b910a820a-3
00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:49.294
elevation raster, each cell will
have a value within zero to 1386

26aba191-0680-49ff-8e94-c61b910a820a-4
00:03:49.294 --> 00:03:52.540
metres. So if we zoom in, we can
still

536f408d-3189-4844-9709-cb048efb80a0-0
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.752
see that it's made-up of lots of
cells and these cells have a

536f408d-3189-4844-9709-cb048efb80a0-1
00:03:59.752 --> 00:04:03.430
value within this range of 0 to
1386

a7d130dd-f2af-411f-842d-c1ee8d8f3e55-0
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.680
So aerial photographs are also a
type of continuous raster.

da16446e-1728-4633-9ebe-331324950874-0
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.741
So that's the different types of
GIS data. To recap, GIS data can

da16446e-1728-4633-9ebe-331324950874-1
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:20.980
be a vector or raster, and
vector data can be points,

efd5117c-66eb-445e-ba7b-47827887cd2e-0
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.190
lines

1e071a63-e8b4-4253-983f-380784f0101d-0
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.640
or polygons.

fa795cdf-d773-46a7-95b0-7ef1ddda9581-0
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.240
And raster data

e20a623c-775a-432b-88c7-740652d9fac7-0
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.246
is made-up of cells with
different values and can be

e20a623c-775a-432b-88c7-740652d9fac7-1
00:04:35.246 --> 00:04:35.730
discrete

f5f34924-ada6-4e23-81ea-739c9602fa10-0
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.530
or continuous.
